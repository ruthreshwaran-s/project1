  A WikiProject is a group of contributors who want to work together as a team to improve Wikipedia. These groups often focus on a specific topic area (for example, WikiProject Mathematics or WikiProject India), a specific part of the encyclopedia (for example, WikiProject Disambiguation), or a specific kind of task (for example, checking newly created pages). The English Wikipedia currently has over 2,000 WikiProjects, about 1,000 of which are monitored by 30â€“2,000 editors, all with varying levels of activity.

The pages of a WikiProject are the central place for editor collaboration on a particular topic area. Editors there develop criteria, maintain various collaborative processes and keep track of work that needs to be done. It also provides a venue where issues of interest to the editors of a subject may be discussed. WikiProjects often write advice for editors, use bots to track what is happening at articles of interest to the group, and create lists of tools and templates the project's participants commonly use.
